Holly Smith Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 5 Ways  
===

I used these tools to create my five visualizations:
1. d3
2. R + plotly
3. Matlab
2. Datawrapper
3. Excel
4. Flourish

I didn't realize at first that I was nearing five visualizations and hadn't done three with programming lanugages. So, Matlab was actully the sixth visualization I made, but I had already made the other five so I kept all six in!

# d3

My d3 visualization probably took the longest to make, since every part has to be created at a low level, but it was also one of the ones I most enjoyed creating. I feel like I had the most control over individual elements of my chart in d3, compared to other tools. I can see why d3 is so popular in the data visualization space, and I'd definitely use it again to create visualizations that I can get extremely close to my exact specifications.

# R + plotly

I really enjoyed making this visualization in R. I decided to not make it using ggplot, though, and instead another library I found onlin called plotly. I used ggplot in my statistics couse a bit, so I wanted to try something else. I found great documentation and examples for plotly, so it made the code to make the bubble chart easy to piece together.

The one big challenge I faced with this chart, however, was I could not figure out how to make a legend for the bubble sizes. I looked through the plotly documentation for scatter charts and bubble charts, and could not find anything. So, I added a hover effect to my bubbles instead, which displays the bill length of the bubble the mouse is over, along with other information.
